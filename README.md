# Autism_Detection
Autism Prediction System using Machine Learning classifiers to support early diagnosis from behavioral data.


# 🧠 Autism Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of autism in individuals based on behavioral and demographic features using machine learning techniques. It aims to support early detection by analyzing patterns in a dataset and applying classification models.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is a structured questionnaire-based dataset containing features like age, gender, test results, and other behavioral indicators. It exhibits **class imbalance**, requiring resampling techniques like SMOTE.

## 🧪 Algorithms Used

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* XGBoost Classifier

## ⚙️ Techniques Applied

* Data Preprocessing
* Label Encoding
* Handling Missing Values
* Class Balancing using SMOTE
* Model Training & Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion Matrix

## 💡 Key Learnings

* How to handle imbalanced datasets
* Practical application of ML in healthcare
* Model comparison and performance analysis

## 📁 Files

* `Autism_detection_latest.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook with complete implementation.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Deploying the model as a web application
* Adding cross-validation
* Using deep learning models for higher accuracy

## 👩‍⚕️ Use Case

This model demonstrates how machine learning can assist in supporting early autism diagnosis, potentially helping medical professionals and caregivers with preliminary screening.
